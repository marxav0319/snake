# snake

An implementation of the classic game "Snake" in pygame.  I'm working on this little project as part
of a larger effort to start working on building small game engines.  Eventually I'll probably
re-implement this in C++ with SDL2 or some other library before moving on to slightly larger
projects, but pygame affords me the ability to focus more on game logic and less on some of the more
involved C++ syntax for now.

## Progress

This is a work in progress and is not yet playable.

## Requirements

+ `python 3.6+`
+ `pygame`
